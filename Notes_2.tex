\begin{itemize}
  \item Drawback: Not for one-vs-all
  \item Multi-label (instance?) as semi-supervised or multi-class of fussy?
  \item Other: Multi-label learning, regression, clustering, semi-supervised
  \item Kernel density estimation
  \item Dimensionality
  \item Prototype = pdf from training set?
  \item No estimation of weight
  \item Drawback of classical CBIR
